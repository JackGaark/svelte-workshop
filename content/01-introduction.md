title: Introduction

Welcome to the [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) Svelte workshop! This is the companion site to the video course that, if you're one of the select few, you're currently watching LIVE; after the course ends it will live on as a companion resource, full of code samples and links and what-have-you.

[Issues and pull requests](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/svelte-workshop) are welcome.


## About this workshop

Here's the plan: we're going to go from 'I had heard of Svelte, but wasn't sure how to pronounce it' to building a dynamically server-rendered, progressively-enhanced, personalisable, interactive (but JS-optional!) PWA, all in the space of a few hours.

It'll happen in four parts:

* The introductory waffly bit, where I explain what Svelte is
* A series of short interactive exercises to teach you the fundamentals
* Building a simple game
* Building a complete app

It's ambitious, but I think we can do it. Who's with me?


## About me

Speaking of 'me', I suppose I should tell you a bit about myself.

I've spent my career in digital journalism, using JavaScript to tell stories in interactive and data-driven ways. These days I'm a proud member of the [New York Times Graphics Department](https://twitter.com/nytgraphics).

That's the day job. By night, I work on open source projects like Svelte, which I started in 2016.

What else do you want to know? AMA. You can find me on Twitter at [@rich_harris](https://twitter.com/rich_harris).


## Acknowledgments

Let me take this opportunity to thank Marc and the rest of the team at Frontend Masters, who work hard to make courses like this one possible; our friends at [Codesmith](https://www.codesmith.io/), who gave us space to record the video; the Svelte community of users and contributors, and YOU, for being here. You're all wonderful.


## Housekeeping

I'm going to be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Svelte Beta](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) extension installed (*not* the one that's just called 'Svelte' — Svelte Beta is a fork of that extension, and will replace it in the near future). I strongly recommend you do the same.

For the final stage of the workshop, we're going to use various free services that you'll need to sign up for. I recommend doing this now, so that everything is ready for later:

* [Fauna](https://fauna.com)
* [Auth0](https://auth0.com)
* [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io) (this one takes a little while to provision API keys, so don't wait until you need it!)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (optional — so that you can deploy your app). You'll also need to install (or update) the Vercel CLI globally with `npm i -g vercel`

## Okay, ready?

Let's do this.
